# KVGE
KVGE is an urban and streetwear brand that I have created. The design is inspired from the popular streetwear brand Supreme. All logos, designs, and shirt mock-ups were created by myself.
## Why?
I wanted to make an e-commerce site for the clothing brand that I had begun working on. I saw this as an opportunity to showcase my abilities in web development and also showcase my creativity and graphic design abilities. A mobile first approach was done when thinking of the overall design of the site.
## How?
This was my first full-stack web-app and several technologies went into creating this such as: React | Redux | JavaScript(ES6) | CSS | Node | Express | Massive | PostgreSQL | Auth0 | Axios.
